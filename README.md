<h1 align="center">Resources for Beginner Front End Developers</h1>

Hello!

I built this repo so I could curate a directory of resources I have found incredibly useful in my learning journey to be a web developer with zero experience. I hope that in creating this repo, I am able to provide even a little bit of help to all budding developers (like me :relaxed:!).

One of my primary motivations is to help beginner devs to be able to easily contribute to open-resource projects. So feel free to contribute to this repo! If you have suggestions, would like to submit new resources, and/or have noticed typo/grammar mistakes, please read the [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

You earn contributions. I learn from you. Everyone learns. Win-win-win for everyone!

With that out of the way, I wish you well on your endeavors. Happy coding!! :grin:

## How to Ask Questions

You may be thinking... "Huh?! Why is this part of this list?" Trust me, knowing how to ask effective technical questions is an extremely important skill to have. As one of the article states:

> Good questions save time. Bad questions waste time.
